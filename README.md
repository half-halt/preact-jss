# preact-jss-tiny

This is a small library which provides support for using JSS in preact. Via the "createUseStyles" function which behaves 
exactly like the version from 'react-jss'.  This has the same refcount/dependecy management of the style sheet, so each 
instance of the component shares the same copy of the style sheet. In addition it supports dynamic (props) based style
properries and also themeing (optional). This is written in typescript and provides full typing as part of the package.
